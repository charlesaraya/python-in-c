# pystructs-in-c

A C implementation of Python’s core data structures — built from scratch to deepen understanding of memory management, generic typing, and algorithmic design in low-level environments.

## Roadmap

### 1. Dynamic Array / List

- **Initialization** with capacity. ✅
- **Length**: get the length of the list. ✅
- **Append**: add an element to the end of the list. ✅
- **Print**: print the list. ✅
- **Insert**: set an element in the list by index (from head and tail). ✅
- **Access**: get an element from the list by index (from head and tail). ✅
- **Membership**: check an element's membership in the list. ✅
- **Minimum**: gets the smallest element in the list. ✅
- **Maximum**: gets the biggest element in the list. ✅
- **Pop**: remove an element from the list by index. ✅
- **Remove**: remove an element from the list by value. ✅
- **Search**: searching for an element in the list.

### Stack (LIFO)

- Push
- Pop
- Peek/top
- Is empty
- Size

### Queue (FIFO)

- Enqueue
- Dequeue
- Peek/front
- Is empty
- Size

### Hash Map / Dictionary
- Basic hashing (modulo-based)
- Chaining or linear probing
- Insert, search, delete
- Key collisions

### Set

- Add
- Remove
- Contains
- Union / Intersection / Difference
