# pystructs-in-c

A C implementation of Python’s core data structures — built from scratch to deepen understanding of memory management, generic typing, and algorithmic design in low-level environments.

## Roadmap

### 1. Dynamic Array / List

- **Initialization** with capacity ✅
- **Append**: add an element to the end of the list ✅
- **Print**: print the list ✅
- **Insert**: set an element in the list by index (from head and tail) ✅
- **Access**: get an element from the list by index (from head and tail) ✅ / value
- **Delete**: remove an element from the list by index / value
- **Search**: searching for an element in the list
