# pystructs-in-c

A C implementation of Python’s core data structures — built from scratch to deepen understanding of memory management, generic typing, and algorithmic design in low-level environments.

- Pop
- Peek/top
- Is empty
- Size

### Queue (FIFO)

- Enqueue
- Dequeue
- Peek/front
- Is empty
- Size

### Hash Map / Dictionary
- Basic hashing (modulo-based)
- Chaining or linear probing
- Insert, search, delete
- Key collisions

### Set

- Add
